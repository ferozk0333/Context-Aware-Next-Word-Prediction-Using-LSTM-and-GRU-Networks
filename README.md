# Context-Aware Next Word Prediction Using LSTM and GRU

## Overview
This project implements a **Next Word Prediction** system using **LSTM** and **GRU** networks, trained on **Shakespeareâ€™s Hamlet**. It leverages deep learning techniques such as tokenization, sequence padding, and softmax-based word prediction. The model is built using **TensorFlow** and deployed via **Streamlit** for real-time text generation.

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, text normalization, sequence generation, and padding  
2. **Model Training**: LSTM/GRU-based RNN architecture with embedding, recurrent, and dense layers  
3. **Evaluation**: Performance comparison between LSTM and GRU  
4. **Deployment**: Streamlit-based web application
