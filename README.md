# Context-Aware-Next-Word-Prediction-Using-LSTM-and-GRU-Networks
Leveraged deep learning techniques such as tokenization, sequence padding, and softmax-based word prediction to develop a Next Word Prediction model using LSTM and GRU networks, trained on Shakespeareâ€™s Hamlet. Built with TensorFlow, this project evaluates and compares the effectiveness of LSTM and GRU architectures for sequence modeling in NLP.
